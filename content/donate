You may or may not have noticed that there are no ads on Teh Playground. I've been running this site since 2010 entirely out of my own pocket, and while server costs have been relatively low, it still does cost money.
I'm never going to put ads on the site, simply because I don't like the look of them, and the traditional methods of monetising a site such as Teh Playground would require users to register accounts and purchasing access to features behind a pay-gate, which just makes me feel dirty.

Teh Playground is a free tool, and I don't want to limit it's access to anyone, anywhere, ever.

Having said that, if you regularly use Teh Playground and have enjoyed your patronage over the last few years, please consider putting a monthly donation towards my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/silvervest). Donating will help me offset the server cost, and allow me to develop new features for it in my spare time.

Thank you!
