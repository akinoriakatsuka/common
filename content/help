## Help!

#### What do I do?
Using Teh Playground couldn't be simpler: type the PHP code you want to test into the editor on the left side of the screen and then click on the 'Save and Run' button at the bottom (or press Ctrl+Enter) to render the code and view the resulting output on the right side of the screen.

#### Formatting
By default, the output from your code will be wrapped in `<pre>` tags, to make it render in an easier-to-read format. If you'd like to disable that, simply mouse-over the menu on the left side of the window and uncheck the `Wrap in <pre>` option.
New to Teh Playground is the option to render your output as MarkDown. This is especially useful if you're testing some actual rendering code, and want to see the output in a nice format, and also share it with other people.

#### PHP Version
Another new feature to Teh Playground is the ability to pick which version of PHP your code snippet will be run against. By default, it's set to use the Latest version that Teh Playground supports.
If you'd like to render against a different version, simply pull out the left hand side menu by mousing over it, drop down the `PHP Version` item and pick your version, then click the `Save and Run` button to see how it goes.

#### Settings
The settings that you pick in the left hand menu are saved with your code snippet, so if you want to share your code that's wrapped in `<pre>` tags and run against PHP version 5.3.4 with your colleague, simply choose those settings, `Save and Run` your code at least once, then share the resulting URL!
